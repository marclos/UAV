# Overview

This air quality station uses a PMS5003 particulate matter sensor, BME280 temperature/pressure/humidity sensor, MiCS-2714 nitrous oxide sensor, and a MQ-131 ozone sensor to measure the air quality in a small, light, and inexpensive package.  In general, each of these sensors needs a power source, a ground, and a communication method in order to function.  The following guide includes the physical setup of these sensors, as well as the code which allows the weather station to collect data.

# Materials Needed

- 1 PMS5003 (including wire connector and Pi adaptor)
- 1 BME280 (including header strip)
- 1 analog to digital convertor
- 1 logic level convertor
- 1 MiCS-2714 (including quickstart board and jumper)
- 1 MQ-131 (including header strip)
- 2 F-F connecting wires
- 19 M-F connecting wires
- 12 M-M connecting wires
- 1 breadboard

# Wiring

The following is an example of the wiring diagram connecting each of the sensors, the breadboard, and the Pi.  While your placements on the breadboard do not need to match this image exactly, it is a good visual guide to how a breadboard functions.  You can reference it if you are confused by any of the following wirign instructions.

![Wiring Diagram](WiringDiagram2.png)

## Breadboard Labeling

Before we wire the actual sensors, it will be useful to set up our breadboard.  What a breadboard does is it allows you to connect multiple elements to the same input pin on the Raspberry Pi; the board is arranged in a series of ~65 horizontal rows that are split in half by a plastic bridge, and four vertical rows.  So, for example, pins placed in 35a and 35d (within the same horizontal row) are connected through the breadboard.

Because we have limited power and grounding sources on the Pi, we need to use them efficiently; a breadboard takes care of this for us.  Before we start, it will be useful to assign three of the four vertical rows to: ground, 3.3. volt power, and 5v power.  You can label these on the board itself.  Every input that needs 3.3 volts of power, for example, can now be connected to your 3.3V row, which we will later connect to the 3.3V power output pin on the Pi. 

## PMS5003 Wiring

Our PMS5003 particulate matter sensor sends input to the Pi via UART, and needs both a 5V power source and a grounding source.  To assemble, snuggly attach the connector that comes with your sensor to both the sensor and the Raspberry Pi adaptor.  The adaptor (the small, green piece with the eight output pins) is what you will connect to the Pi.  

* Provide power to the sensor by using a M-F wire to connect the VCC terminal on the adaptor with the 5V column on your breadboard.

* Ground your sensor by using a M-F wire to connect the GND terminal on the adaptor to the grounding column on your breadboard.

* Begin establishing communication between the sensor and the Pi by using a F-F wire to connect the RXD terminal on the adaptor to the TXD pin on the Pi (pin 8/GPIO 14).  Pay attention to this labeling -- unintuitively, the RXD is connected to the TXD pin on the Pi (not the RXD pin!).

* Conclude establishing communication by connecting the TXD terminal on the adaptor to the RXD pin on the Pi (pin 10/GPIO 15) with another F-F wire. 

## BME280 Wiring

Our BME280 temperature, humidity and pressure sensor sends input to the Pi via I2C, and requires a ground as well as a 3.3V power source.  The sensor does need some soldering in order to attach the header pins to the sensor, which you can find information on in the soldering guide.  These instructions assume that your sensor is already connected to your header pins.  Begin by placing your BME280 in your breadboard such that it allows you to insert connecting wires in the same horizontal row as the various pins on the sensor.

* Provide power to the sensor with a M-M wire connecting the VIN terminal on the BME280 to the 3.3V column on the breadboard.

* Ground the sensor with a M-M wire connecting the GND terminal on the BME280 to the ground column on the breadboard.

* Begin establishing communication between the sensor and the Pi with a M-F wire connecting the SCK terminal on the BME280 to the SCL pin on the Pi (pin 5/GPIO 3).

* Conclude establishing communication with a M-F wire connecting the SDI terminal on the BME280 to the SDA pin on the Pi (pin 3/GPIO 2).
 
## ADC Wiring

Before we begin setting up our final sensor (the MiCS-2714 nitrous oxide sensor), we need to create a path of communication between it and the Pi.  The MiCS-2714 only provides analog data, whereas the Pi can only interpret digital data signals; therefore, we need an analog to digital converter (ADC) so that the two can communicate.  Begin by placing the ADC on the breadboard so that it bridges the plastic gap between the horizontal rows; make sure the sensor is facing the right direction, with the indented circle facing the "bottom" (higher level rows) of the breadboard.  Unfortunately, our ADC is not labeled, so the following instructions are relative to its position on the breadboard (for example "pin 1a on the ADC" refers to the pin with the lowest numerical equivalent on the breadboard in the row furthest from the circle -- if the ADC is between rows 24 and 31, this refers to row 24).  "A" refers to the side of the ADC furthest to the circle, and the "B" refers to the side of the ADC nearest to the indented circle. 

Our ADC convertor needs a 3 volt power source, a ground, and to establish communication with the Pi via SPI.

* Provide power to the convertor with a M-M wire connecting pin 7 on the convertor to the 3.3V column on the breadboard.

* Ground the convertor with two M-M wires, one connecting pin 1 on the convertor to the ground column on the breadboard, and the second connecting pin 6 on the convertor to the ground column on the breadboard.

* Begin establishing communication between the convertor and the Pi with a M-F wire connecting pin 2 on the convertor to the CE1 pin on the Pi (pin 24/GPIO 7).

* Continue with a M-F wire connecting pin 3 on the convertor to the MOSI pin on the Pi (pin 19/GPIO 10).

* Next use a M-F wire to connect pin 4 on the convertor to the MISO pin on the Pi (pin 21/GPIO 9).

* Conclude establishing communication with a M-F wire connecting pin 5 on the convertor to the SCLK pin on the Pi (pin 23/GPIO 11).

## LLC Wiring

Unfortunately, using the ADC creates more problems for us; the MiCS-2714 sensor provides 5V data output, but the ADC only reads 3.3V data.  To solve this problem, we need a logic level convertor (or LLC) to lower the power of the signal to 3.3 volts.  Our logic level convertor needs a ground, a 5 volt power source, a 3 volt power source, and a connection to the ADC.  Place the LLC so that is bridging the plastic gap in the center of the breadboard.

* Provide the 5 volt power to the convertor with a M-M wire connecting the HV terminal on the convertor to the 5V column on the breadboard.

* Provide the 3 volt power to the convertor with a M-M wire connecting the LV terminal on the convertor to the 3.3V column on the breadboard.

* Ground the convertor with two M-M wires, one connecting each of the two GND terminals on the convertor the grounding column on the breadboard.

* Establish communication with the ADC with a M-M wire connecting the RXD terminal on the LLC to pin 8b on the ADC (the "lowest" pin on the breadboard, on the side nearest to the circle).

## MiCS-2714 Wiring

Our MiCS-2714 nitrous oxide reader and quickstart board is simply assembled: place the sensor in the fitted plastic bed on the quickstart board, and use one of the jumpers to cover pins J3 and J4 on the quickstart board.  Now, all that the sensor needs is a 5 volt power source, a ground, and to be connected to the LLC.

* Provide power to the sensor with a M-F wire connecting the Vin+ pin on the sensor to the 5V column on the breadboard.

* Ground the sensor with a M-F wire connecting the GND pin on the sensor to the grounding column on the breadboard.

* Establish communication between the sensor and the LLC with a M-F wire connecting the VoutB pin on the sensor to the RX1 pin on the LLC.

* Send the signal to the ADC by using a M-M wire to connect the RX0 pin on the LLC that is directly across from the RX1 pin where you connected the sensor to one of the channels on the MCP3008 (the code below assumes you use Channel 0, which is in position 8a on the ADC - you will need to change this if you connect to another channel).

## MQ-131 Wiring

Similarly to the BME280, the MQ-131 needs some soldering; and similarly to the MiCS-2714, because this sensor produces a 5V analog signal, it needs a logic level convertor to decrease the signal to 3V, and an analog to digital convertor to change the signal to digital.  Luckily, we will be able to use the same LLC and ADC as we already had set up for the MiCS-2714.  Beyond the signal output being passed through the LLC and ADC, the MQ-131 also needs a ground and a 5 volt power source.  If the MQ-131 you are using has a high concentration AND a low concentration sensor, you will need to ground and provide power to each one; however, the code below only has input for readings from one of these sensors (if you wanted both, we would need a second LLC).  The low concentration sensor is good for cooler, indoor environments; the high concentration sensor is good for hotter, outdoor environments.  Assuming you are setting this up indoors, the wiring below has information for how to connect the low concentration sensor; however, if you want to use the high concentration sensor, all you need to do is change the connecting wire from the "OUTL" (low concentration output) pin on the MQ-131 to the "OUTH" (high concentration output) pin directly next to it.

* Provide power to the sensor with two M-F wires connecting the two VCC pins on the sensor (one for high and one for low concentration) to the 5V column on the breadboard.

* Ground the sensor with two M-F wire connecting the two GND pins on the sensor to the grounding column on the breadboard.

* Establish communication between the sensor and the LLC with a M-F wire connecting the OUTL pin on the sensor to the other RX1 pin on the LLC (that does not have the MiCS-2714 connection).

* Send the signal to the ADC by using a M-M wire to connect the RX0 pin on the LLC that is directly across from the RX1 pin where you connected the sensor to one of the channels on the MCP3008 (the code below assumes you use Channel 1, which is in position 7a on the ADC - you will need to change this if you connect to another channel).

## Breadboard Wiring

Now all that is left is to connect each of your established columns on the breadboard to the Raspberry Pi.

* Connect the 5V column on the breadboard to one of the 5V pins on the Pi (either pin 2 or 4) with a M-F wire.

* Connect the 3V column on the breadboard to one of the 3.3V pins on the Pi (either pin 1 or 17) with a M-F wire.

* Connect the grounding column on the breadboard to one of the GND pins on the Pi (either pin 6, 9, 14, etc.) with a M-F wire.

Now, you can attach your Pi to power, and your sensors are connected!

## Settings

Now that the station is assembled, we need to prepare our Raspberry Pi to be able to receive and process the signals from our sensors.  To do so, there are several settings we need to change.

Our sensors use several different communication methods with the Pi, which is fortunate because it allows us to run all of them at the same time!  The following instructions will help you enable communication with the BME280 (I2C), PMS5003 (Serial), and MiCS-2714 (SPI).

1.  Enter the Raspberry Pi's configuration page by opening the shell and typing
```{python, eval=FALSE, python.reticulate=FALSE}
sudo raspi-config
```
which will take you to a menu with several options listed.

2.  Select option 5, "Interfacing Options."

3.  Within this page, enable the following portals by selecting them and then indicating "Yes," that you do want them to run:

- I2C

- SPI

4.  We now need to enable serial communication.  Within the same menu, select Serial.  

5. A window will pop up asking, "would you like a login shell to be accessible over serial?", and the answer is NO.

6.  Next, a window will pop up asking, "Would you like the serial port hardware to be enabled?", this time say YES, and exit the window.

4.  Once you have enabled these options, you can exit the screen and begin installing the necessary packages.  It may ask you to reboot you Pi, in which case do so before moving on.

## Packages Needed

Before we can use our code, there are several packages that need to be downloaded.  To do so, enter your Raspberry Pi's shell and enter the following commands.

First, it is essential that you make sure your Pi is up-to-date, so that you can get the latest versions of each package.  Do this with the following two commands:
```{python, eval=FALSE, python.reticulate=FALSE}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

We always suggest you reboot after new updating your Pi:
```{python, eval=FALSE, python.reticulate=FALSE}
sudo shutdown -r now (or sudo reboot)
```
## MiCS-2714 Packages  -- Title seems disconnected to code for MCP3008?

The MiCS-2714 sensor code operates with a github package that controls the MCP3008 (the analog to digital convertor that allows the Pi to read our sensor's signals).  To install these packages, run each of the lines of the following code within your Pi's shell:

```{python, eval=FALSE, python.reticulate=FALSE}
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-smbus git 
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_MCP3008.git
cd Adafruit_Python_MCP3008
sudo python setup.py install
cd ~
```

## BME280 Packages

Our BME280 also operates with an Adafruit package on Github, which can be accessed with the following commands within the Pi shell:

```{python, eval=FALSE, python.reticulate=FALSE}
pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-bme280
pip3 install --upgrade adafruit_blinka
```

These are all the packages we need to run our code, so now you can import the code and get your station running!

## Air Quality Station Code

The following code will output values to a csv file entitled "airquality_data.csv", with readings for: NO2 levels in ppm; PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 levels in standard and environmental units of ug/m^3; temperature in celsius, humidity, air pressure, and altitude. 

To use this code, copy and paste it into a python shell within your Pi (either Nano, Thonny, or IDLE) and run the code per your chosen shell's commands.

```{python, eval=FALSE, python.reticulate=FALSE}
